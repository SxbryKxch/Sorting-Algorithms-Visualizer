### Features

- Visualizations for multiple sorting algorithms.
- Real-time ASCII art representations.
- Educational and interactive.
- Easy-to-follow code structure.
- Customizable and extensible for additional algorithms.

### Algorithms Included

1. **Bubble Sort**: The classic sorting algorithm known for its simplicity.
2. **Selection Sort**: A straightforward algorithm for sorting small datasets.
3. **Insertion Sort**: Builds the sorted array one item at a time.
4. **Merge Sort**: A divide-and-conquer approach for efficient sorting.
5. **Quick Sort**: A highly efficient and widely used sorting algorithm.

### Getting Started

1. Clone or fork this repository to your local machine.
2. Make sure you have a C++ compiler installed.
3. Compile and run the `main.cpp` file to visualize sorting algorithms.
